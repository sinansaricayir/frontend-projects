# Vanilla JS-Projects


Hi , this is mini projects in HTML, CSS & JavaScript that relate to the DOM (Document Object Model).



I just want to learn how the document object model works are essential before moving to a framework and also learn more about HTML5 and CSS including semantic tags in your markup, basic CSS properties such as colors, alignment, flexbox, and shadows as well as creating responsive layouts with CSS media queries, CSS custom properties, animations/transitions, and more.
